# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced approach to text generation that combines **retrieval techniques** with **generative language models**. Unlike traditional generative models that rely solely on pre-trained data, RAG incorporates external knowledge bases or datasets to generate contextually accurate and up-to-date responses.

This repository demonstrates how to implement a RAG pipeline, leveraging tools like **FAISS** for retrieval and **transformers** for generation. This approach is particularly useful in applications such as:
- Chatbots
- Customer service automation
- Domain-specific knowledge generation

## Purpose of the Code

The purpose of this notebook is to:
1. Set up and implement a **RAG pipeline**.
2. Integrate a knowledge base for **retrieval and response generation**.
3. Illustrate how RAG can improve accuracy and relevance in text generation tasks.

---

## Features

- **Document Retrieval**: Use a pre-defined knowledge base to find relevant information.
- **Generative Model**: Leverage pre-trained language models to synthesize responses.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Seamless combination of retrieval and generation for accurate outputs.

## Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
Install and import the required libraries, including:
- `transformers`
- `faiss-cpu`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `datasets`

```python
!pip install transformers faiss-cpu sentence-transformers datasets
import transformers
import faiss
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from datasets import load_dataset
```

### 2. Loading the Dataset
Load a dataset to serve as the knowledge base for retrieval.

```python
dataset = load_dataset('some_dataset_name')
documents = [doc['text'] for doc in dataset['train']]
```

### 3. Building the Retriever
Embed the documents using **Sentence Transformers** and index them with **FAISS** for efficient similarity search.

```python
model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(documents)
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings.shape[1])
index.add(embeddings)
```

### 4. Query Retrieval
Retrieve the most relevant documents for a given query.

```python
query = "What is retrieval-augmented generation?"
query_embedding = model.encode([query])
top_k = 3
_, retrieved_indices = index.search(query_embedding, top_k)
retrieved_docs = [documents[i] for i in retrieved_indices[0]]
```

### 5. Generating a Response
Combine the query and retrieved documents, then use a generative model to synthesize a response.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

gen_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

input_text = query + " ".join(retrieved_docs)
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True)
outputs = gen_model.generate(**inputs)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### 6. Evaluation
Evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the generated response by:
- Comparing with ground truth.
- Using human feedback for qualitative assessment.

## Input and Output Examples

### Input Example
```plaintext
Query: "Explain the benefits of RAG in AI."
```

### Step-by-Step Process
1. Encode the query.
2. Retrieve top-3 relevant documents from the knowledge base.
3. Concatenate retrieved documents with the query.
4. Generate a response using a generative model.

### Output Example
```plaintext
Response: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the strengths of retrieval systems and generative models to create accurate and contextually relevant responses. It ensures up-to-date information by leveraging external knowledge bases."
```
