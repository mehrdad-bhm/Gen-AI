# Gen-AI
The primary objective of this project is to show the ability to fine-tune to enhance the
model performance in a specific task. Also, it will show how existing large language
models can be used in the data collection process to enhance relatively small models.
This will involve the use of a suitable dataset for fine-tuning a model for code generation,
the choice of a suitable small model to be fine-tuned on the Colab notebook, the design
of the experiment setup and evaluation matrices and choosing the correct prompt for
generation of the synthesised data.
